# Currency Converter Project

This is a web application that helps users convert currency from one country to another. I built this project to practice JavaScript and learning how to fetch data from APIs.

## Features
- Real-time currency conversion
- Auto update flags based on the country selected
- Cool glowing border animation in CSS
- Simple user interface

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## APIs used
I used two free apis for this project:
1. **Currency API:** (fawazahmed0/currency-api) to get the exchange rates.
2. **Flags API:** To display the country flag images next to the dropdown.

## How to run
You dont need to install any node modules. Just download the folder and open the `index.html` file in Chrome or any browser.

## Note
Sometimes the api might take a second to load the data depending on the internet connection.
